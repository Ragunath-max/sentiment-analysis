# Sentiment Analysis using NLP

This project performs **sentiment analysis** on user review text data
using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques in Python.
The model predicts whether the sentiment of a given text is **Positive** or **Negative**.

## Features
- Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization)
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Machine Learning based sentiment classification
- Simple and efficient implementation

## Files
- Mini_Project.py – Main sentiment analysis implementation
- reviews.xlsx – Dataset used for sentiment analysis
- README.md – Project documentation

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NLP

## Project Purpose
This project is created to:
- Understand sentiment analysis using NLP
- Analyze user reviews automatically
- Apply Machine Learning techniques on text data

## How to Run
